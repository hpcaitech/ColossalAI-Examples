    "# Document deduplication using Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) with minhash\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook gives an overview of locality sensitive hashing for the purpose of deduplicating large collections of documents. The associated code is available from https://github.com/mattilyra/lsh.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding exact duplicates is trivially easy (just use `md5`) but finding near duplicates is much harder. Many document collections from tweets to news text to forum discussions contain documents that are almost exactly the same, with only a few sentences or characters that differ. A hash function such as `md5` won't find these near duplicates as they are not the same on the byte level, but rather on the semantic level. Finding these semantic duplicates can be done, for instance, by using n-gram shingles and computing the Jaccard similarity of the shingle sets. This is computationally very expensive as the similarity between all pairs of documents needs to be computed. The <cite>Reuters Corpus Version 1.0 (RCV1)</cite> [1] is ~810k documents, that's $810000^2 = 656100000000$ comparisons, assuming the we have a really fast computer that can generate a pair of shingles and compute their Jaccard similarity in 1 microsecond, that still takes a bit over a week to go through all of them, luckily the similarities are symmetric so going through half of $656100000000$ is enough, that is still ~3 days. The <cite>Amazon Product Data</cite> [2] is what could be called webscale ~140 million product reviews. I don't even want to think about how long that would take."

    "Locality senstive hashing (LSH) relies on two different methods, first a hash fingerprint of each document is created and then the locality sensitive hashing is applied to that fingerprint. If the fingerprint is generated using the `minhash` algorithm then the probability of a hash collision is equal to the Jaccard distance of the documents. There are other hash functions that correspond to the cosine similarity for instance, but I won't deal with those here.\n",

    "Minhash is a hash function that computes the lowest hash value for a set of objects to be hashes. In the case of comparing document similarities the set of objects is word or character ngrams taken over a sliding window from the document - also known as shingles. The set of shingles allows us to compute the document similarity (defined in this case as Jaccard similarity) between a pair of documents.\n",

    "As we can see these two documents are not very similar, at least in terms of their 3-gram shingle Jaccard similarity. That aside the problem with these shingles is that they do not allow us to compute the similarities of large numbers of documents very easily, we have to do an all pairs comparison. To get around that we can use locality sensitive hashing, but before LSH we'll turn the documents into a more manageable and uniform representation: a fixed length _fingerprint_ comprised of $k$ `minhash`es.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every document has a different number of shingles depending on the length of the document, for a corpus of any size predicting the memory requirements for an all pairs comparison is not possible as each document will consume a variable amount of memory. For LSH we would like to have a fixed length representation of the documents without changing the semantics of document similarity. This is where `minhash`ing comes in. It turns out that the probability of a hash collision for a `minhash` is exactly the Jaccard similarity of two sets. This can be seen by considering the two sets of shingles as a matrix. For two dummy documents the shingles could be represented as the table below (the zeros and ones indicate if a shingle is present in the document or not). Notice that the Jaccard similarity of the documents is `2/5`.\n",

Since the rows with zeros on them don't count, there are 5 rows with a one on it in any column, and two rows with a 1 in both columns. All a random permutation can therefore do is put two out of the five rows in the lowest row number, in other words produce a hash collision with a probability `2/5`.\n",

This being a probabilitic measure you're not guaranteed to get a collision. For Lorem Ipsum documents above and $k=100$ we get similarities that are roughly the same as the Jaccard similarity."

    "## Locality sensitive hashing\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind locality sensitive hashing is to take the document fingerprints and chop them up into pieces, each piece being some number of `minhash`es. Since a single `minhash` (single entry in the fingerprint) has a probability equal to the Jaccard similarity of producing a collision, each chopped up portion of the fingerprint should as well. This chopped up portion is the `locality` in locality sensitive hashing, the `hashing` is just a hash function (any hash function) which produces a `bin ID` from the fingerprint `locality` being hashed. Each bin holds the entire fingerprint (with optional meta information) of the document and that of other documents that hash to the same `bin`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say our fingerprint has 100 `minhash`es in it and we chop the fingerprints into 10 pieces. Each piece of each fingerprint therefore contains 10 `minhash`es, we hash those again (not using `minhash` this time) to get a `bin ID` and store the whole fingerprint in every bin each of the pieces happens to land in.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we want to know which documents are similar to a query document, we look in all the bins the query document lands in, any document in any of the bins is a potential duplicate. Comparing the full fingerprint of all documents in the bin or computing the actual Jaccard similarity between the shingle sets yields the final similarity of documents. Crucially _since not all documents will land in the same bins we've reduced the number of comparisons needed to find similar or near duplicate documents_.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of pieces to chop each fingerprint into and the size of each piece are parameters that need to be set. These should be set such that $num\\_pieces \\times size\\_of\\_piece == num\\_minhashes$ - this makes sense since having computed all the $N$ `minhash`es we want to use all of them in the locality sensitive hashing part. There is however a further issue that needs to be considered when setting the parameters; the relation between the number and size of the pieces and the probability of LSH \"finding\" a pair of similar documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "LSH is a probabilistic model which means that it won't always do the \"right thing\". Using LSH one needs to consider the similarity of a pair of documents (in this case the Jaccard similarity) and the probability that LSH will find that pair to be similar (a true positive, i.e. a correctly discovered duplicate pair). The pair of documents LSH finds to be similar should be thought of as _candidate_ duplicates. The higher the probability, or guarantee, that LSH will find a pair of documents to be similar the more false positives the model will also produce, that is candidate duplicates that are not in fact duplicates."

      "2286\tRecovery excitement brings Mexican markets to life.  Emerging evidence that Mexico's economy was back on the recovery track sent Mexican markets into a buzz of excitement Tuesday, with stocks closing at record highs and interest rates at 19-month lows. \"Mexico has been trying to stage a recovery since the beginning of this year and it's always been getting ahead of itself in terms of fundamentals,\" said Matthew Hickman of Lehman Brothers in New York. \"Now we're at the point where the fundamentals are with us. The history is now falling out of view.\" That history is one etched into the minds of all investors in Mexico: an economy in crisis since December 1994, a free-falling peso and stubbornly high interest rates. This week, however, second-quarter gross domestic product was reported up 7.2 percent, much stronger than most analysts had expected. Interest rates on governent Treasury bills, or Cetes, in the secondary market fell on Tuesday to 23.90 percent, their lowest level since Jan. 25, 1995. The stock market's main price index rallied 77.12 points, or 2.32 percent, to a record 3,401.79 points, with volume at a frenzied 159.89 million shares. Confounding all expectations has been the strength of the peso, which ended higher in its longer-term contracts on Tuesday despite the secondary Cetes drop and expectations of lower benchmark rates in Tuesday's weekly auction. With U.S. long-term interest rates expected to remain steady after the Federal Reserve refrained from raising short-term rates on Tuesday, the attraction of Mexico, analysts say, is that it offers robust returns for foreigners and growing confidence that they will not fall victim to a crumbling peso. \"The focus is back on Mexican fundamentals,\" said Lars Schonander, head of researcher at Santander in Mexico City. \"You have a continuing decline in inflation, a stronger-than-expected GDP growth figure and the lack of any upward move in U.S. rates.\" Other factors were also at play, said Felix Boni, head of research at James Capel in Mexico City, such as positive technicals and economic uncertainty in Argentina, which has put it and neighbouring Brazil's markets at risk. \"There's a movement out of South American markets into Mexico,\" he said. But Boni was also wary of what he said could be \"a lot of hype.\" The economic recovery was still export-led, and evidence was patchy that the domestic consumer was back with a vengeance. Also, corporate earnings need to grow strongly to justify the run-up in the stock market, he said. \r\n"
